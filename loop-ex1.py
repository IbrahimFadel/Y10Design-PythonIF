# Loops help us to do a particular task many times
# Example 1

# The range() function defaults to 0 as a starting value, however it is possible 
# to specify the starting value by adding a parameter: range(a, b, c) which means 
# values from 'a' to 'b' (but not including 'b') and increases by 3 each time

for x in range(0, 30, 3):
  print(x)
