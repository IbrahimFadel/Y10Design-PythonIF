          <h2>First Languages</h2>
          <h5>1950s</h5>
          <p>
            Fortran, LISP, COBOL, and Assembly Languages begin to emerge. The allow programmers to more effectively use computers. Some are more high level (Fortran, LISP, COBOL), while others are as close to the metal  as possible without being binary (Assembly).
          </p>
          <p>
            Instead of using punch cards, programmers can now use english-like syntax to specify actions.

          <h2>Foundation Years</h2>
          <h5>Late 1960-70s</h5>
          <p>
            In these years, some of the most fundamental programming paradigms become main stream. People debate over the use of 'goto' statements. Eventually, it becomes labeled as bad design.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the most influential langues ever, C (predecessor to C++), is created. C came with a great array of built in functionality, and complex data structures.

          <h2>Cementing Paradigms</h2>
          <h5>1980s</h5>
          <p>
            During this time, languages like C++, Common Lisp, Matlab, Objective-C, and Perl came out. These built upon the ideas created in the 70s and cemented the paradigms of imperative programming. A bigger focus was placed on scalability by introducing structured units of code. This practice is known as object oriented programming.

          <h2>Internet Age</h2>
          <h5>1990s</h5>
          <p>
            The 90s saw the introduction of the internet. With this, Javascript gained tremendous popularity for being a very easy to learn 'scripting' language that allowed people to harness the power of the web. Similar 'scripting' languages such as Python gained popularity for their simplicity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some other notable languages created in this time were Haskell, Visual Basic, Lua, R, Ruby, Java, and PHP. The last two may be two of the most important languages of this period. Java is still one of the most popular object oriented programming languages. PHP became a very popular for it's backend capabilities, and while it's being phased out of use, many big websites today still rely on it.

          <h2>Modern Age</h2>
          <p>
            Rust, Go, Dart, Kotlin, Typescript, Swift, C#, and Scala are all very modern languages. They haven't quite been as widely adapted as some other languages, largely because they are so new. Rust, for example, has been around for just around a decade.
          </p>
          <p>
            In general, these languages are simply trying to improve upon existing languages. Rust for example is trying to be as fast as C++ but with safer memory. Typescript is a superset of Javascript with static typing.
